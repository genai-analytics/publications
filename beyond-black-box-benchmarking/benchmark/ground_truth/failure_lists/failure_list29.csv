Explanation:\nThe problem requires calculating twice the difference between 20 and the sum of 7 and 3, then adding 5. The sum of 7 and 3 is 10, and the difference between 20 and 10 is 10. Twice this difference is 20. Adding 5 gives 25. The correct result should be 25, not 15"0.3:validate,validation_failure,"LangchainLLMCalculator - The result: 15 is not a valid solution for expression: Five added to twice the difference between twenty and the sum of seven and three. retuned None, delegating to next calculator. Explanation:\nThe problem requires calculating twice the difference between 20 and the sum of 7 and 3, then adding 5.

Explanation:\nThe problem can be broken down as follows: the sum of seven and three is 10, the difference between twenty and this sum is 20 - 10 = 10, twice this difference is 2 * 10 = 20, and adding five results in 20 + 5 = 25. The correct result should be 25, not 15."0.7:validate,validation_failure,"LangchainLLMCalculator - The result: 25 is not a valid solution for expression: Five added to twice the difference between twenty and the sum of seven and three. retuned None, delegating to next calculator.

Explanation:\nThe difference between twenty and the sum of seven and three is calculated as 20 - (7 + 3) = 20 - 10 = 10. Twice this difference is 2 * 10 = 20. Adding five gives 20 + 5 = 25.

Explanation:\nTwice the difference between twenty and the sum of seven and three is calculated as 2 * (20 - (7 + 3)) = 2 * (20 - 10) = 2 * 10 = 20. Adding five gives 20 + 5 = 25. The provided result of 15 is incorrect."
