However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%. If Kelly was right, 40 people really attended the concert. What was the audience size according to Courtney? retuned None, delegating to next calculator. Explanation:\nAccording to Courtney, the audience size was reported as 48. However, if Kelly states that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, the actual audience size would have been 48 / 1.2 = 40, which matches the correct audience size Kelly reported. Therefore, the result of 48 as Courtney's reported audience size is correct, but the problem statement already acknowledges this, making the verification trivial. The provided result was meant to confirm Courtney's report, so the logic in the problem needs clarification. The result is correct as per Courtney's statement."0.7:validate,validator_failure,"Validator erroneously rejected correct calculation.
