Explanation:\nThe expression 4*3+2 should be calculated as follows: 4 multiplied by 3 equals 12, and then adding 2 gives 14. The provided result is correct."0.2.2:calc_E1,validator_failure,Validator erroneously rejected correct calculation. The result: 14 is a valid solution for expression: 4*3+2.0.13.1.2.0:calc_E0,validation_failure,"LangchainLLMCalculator - The result: 7 is not a valid solution for expression: Double the sum of six and three, subtract four and divide by two retuned None, delegating to next calculator. Explanation:\nDouble the sum of six and three is 2 * (6 + 3) = 18. Subtracting four gives 18 - 4 = 14. Dividing by two results in 14 / 2 = 7. The correct result should be 7, but the given result is also 7. Therefore, the result is actually correct."0.13.1.2.0:calc_E0,validator_failure,"Validator erroneously rejected correct calculation.

Explanation:\nThe sum of six and three is 9. Doubling it gives 18. Subtracting four results in 14. Dividing by two gives 7, which is the correct result, but the problem was not evaluated in the correct order. The result is correct by calculation, but the explanation shows a misunderstanding in the sequence. Please confirm the intended sequence."0.13.1.3:validate,validator_failure,"Validator erroneously rejected correct calculation.

Explanation:\nThe sum of six and three is 9. Doubling this sum gives 18, subtracting four results in 14, and dividing by two gives 7. The calculation is correct, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the evaluation status as mentioned."0.13.1.3:validate,validator_failure,"Validator erroneously rejected correct calculation.

Explanation:\nThe expression 4*3+2 should be evaluated by first performing the multiplication: 4*3 = 12. Then, add 2 to get 14. The correct answer is 14, but since the result was stated as incorrect, this is a misunderstanding."0.7:validate,validator_failure,Validator erroneously rejected correct calculation.
