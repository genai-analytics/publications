Then, subtract fifteen.}+3)] retuned None, delegating to next calculator. Explanation:\nFirst, evaluate the expression inside the curly braces: 'Multiply the sum of three, seven, and five by two. Then, subtract fifteen.' This translates to (3 + 7 + 5) * 2 - 15 = 30 - 15 = 15. Then, substitute this value back into the main expression: 6 * [12 - (15 + 3)] = 6 * [12 - 18] = 6 * (-6) = -36. The provided result of 6.0 is incorrect."0.3:validate,validation_failure,"LangchainLLMCalculator - The result: 18 is not a valid solution for expression: 6*[12-({Multiply the sum of three, seven, and five by two. Then, subtract fifteen.}+3)] retuned None, delegating to next calculator. Explanation:\nThe inner expression 'Multiply the sum of three, seven, and five by two. Then, subtract fifteen.' is evaluated as follows: 3 + 7 + 5 = 15, then 15 * 2 = 30, and 30 - 15 = 15. Adding 3 gives 18. The entire expression becomes 6 * [12 - 18], which simplifies to 6 * (-6) = -36. The provided result of 18 is incorrect."0.3:validate,validation_failure,"LangchainLLMCalculator - The result: 45 is not a valid solution for expression: 6*[12-({Multiply the sum of three, seven, and five by two. Then, subtract fifteen.}+3)] retuned None, delegating to next calculator. Explanation:\nFirst, calculate the inner expression: the sum of three, seven, and five is 3 + 7 + 5 = 15. Multiply by two to get 30. Subtract fifteen to get 30 - 15 = 15. Add 3 to get 18. Now, compute the outer expression: 12 - 18 = -6. Multiply by 6 to get -36.
