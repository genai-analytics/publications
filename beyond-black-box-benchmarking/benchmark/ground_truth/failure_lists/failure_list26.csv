For every red balloon, he tossed two pieces of bologna, and for each yellow balloon, he tossed three pieces. If Benny ended up tossing a total of 58 pieces of bologna at a mix of red and yellow balloons, and there were twenty red balloons in the mix, can you determine how many of the balloons were yellow? retuned None, delegating to next calculator. Explanation:\nFor 20 red balloons, Benny tossed 2 pieces per balloon, totaling 20 * 2 = 40 pieces for the red balloons. This leaves 58 - 40 = 18 pieces for the yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon uses 3 pieces, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6. Therefore, the provided result is correct, but the explanation was missing."0.2.0:calc_E0,validator_failure,"Validator erroneously rejected correct calculation.
