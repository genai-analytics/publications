The expression may include pre-existing variable references of the form E0, E1, etc., representing sub-expressions that have already been calculated.\n\n            **Bracket Types and Rules:**\n            1. **Brackets:**\n            - Parentheses: `( ... )`\n            - Square Brackets: `[ ... ]`\n            - Curly Brackets: `{ ... }`\n            2. Treat square brackets `[]` and curly brackets `{}` as equivalent to parentheses `()` for grouping and preserving the order of operations.\n            3. Do not interchange, omit, or remove any type of bracket. Each bracket type must be used consistently for its intended purpose.\n            4. Format all mathematical expressions with clear and consistent grouping, using the same type of bracket for each nesting level.\n\n            **Processing Instructions:**\n            - **Identification:** Scan the input expression and extract every **top-level** bracketed segment. Ignore any brackets nested inside these segments; they should remain intact as part of the content.\n            - **New Operation Creation:** For each top-level bracket found, create a new operation entry with the following properties:\n            - `\"operation\"`: One of `\"parentheses\"`, `\"square_brackets\"`, or `\"curly_brackets\"`, depending on the type of the bracket.\n            - `\"name\"`: A unique variable identifier in the format `E{n}`. **Important:** If the input expression already contains variable references (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.), then the index `n` for any new operation must be strictly greater than the highest index already present. For example, if the expression contains `E0` and `E1`, the first new operation must be named `E2`.\n            - `\"op1\"`: The exact content inside the top-level brackets (do not alter or decompose it, even if it contains nested brackets).\n            - `\"op2\"`: An empty string `\"\"`.\n            - **Expression Replacement:** Replace each top-level bracketed segment in the original expression with its corresponding variable name (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.) to form a new expression.\n            - **Final Expression Requirements:** The final `\"new_expression\"` must not contain any parentheses, square brackets, or curly brackets. It should include only:\n            - Numeric values (e.g., `2`, `10`, `3.5`)\n            - Standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)\n            - References to sub-expressions (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.)\n\n            **Output Format:**\n            Return the result as a JSON object with the following structure:\n            {\n            \"operations\": [\n                {\n                \"name\": \"string\",\n                \"operation\": \"parentheses | square_brackets | curly_brackets\",\n                \"op1\": \"string with bracket content\",\n                \"op2\": \"\"\n                },\n                ...\n            ],\n            \"new_expression\": \"string with bracket references replaced by E0, E1, etc.\"\n            }\n\n            ---\n\n            ### Example Inputs and Expected Outputs\n\n            1) Example Input:\n            (5 + {one plus two}+[6+7]-(9*4)) - 2\n\n            Example Output:\n            {\n                \"operations\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E0\",\n                    \"operation\": \"parentheses\",\n                    \"op1\": \"5 + {one plus two}+[6+7]-(9*4)\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                }\n                ],\n                \"new_expression\": \"E0 - 2\"\n            }\n\n            2) Example Input:\n            {some text} + (3+4)\n\n            Example Output:\n            {\n                \"operations\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E0\",\n                    \"operation\": \"curly_brackets\",\n                    \"op1\": \"some text\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E1\",\n                    \"operation\": \"parentheses\",\n                    \"op1\": \"3+4\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                }\n                ],\n                \"new_expression\": \"E0 + E1\"\n            }\n\n            3) Example Input:\n            [E1 - (E2 - 3)] * 2\n\n            (Here, [E1 - (E2 - 3)] is the only top-level bracket.

If the expression asks for multiple numbers instead of a single one (e.g., a range, a set, a list), classify it as invalid.  \n- Examples:  \n    - \"What are the maximum and minimum in the following sequence?\" \u2192 Invalid  \n    - \"List the prime numbers between 1 and 10\" \u2192 Invalid  \n\n4. If the question is open-ended, subjective, or procedural, classify it as invalid.  \n- Examples:  \n    - \"How do I calculate the area of a circle?\" \u2192 Invalid  \n    - \"Are all numbers divisible by 2 even?\" \u2192 Invalid  \n\n### Output Format:  \nReturn a JSON object with the following structure:  \n{\n\"result\": \"valid\" | \"invalid\"\n}\n\n",

You will be provided with textual math questions that may include numbers, words, or a combination of both. Your goal is to interpret the question accurately, translate it into proper mathematical expressions, perform the necessary calculations, and output only the final numeric result.\n\n### Key Guidelines:\n1. **Parse Precisely**: Identify and interpret mathematical operations accurately, including:\n- Addition (e.g., \"5 plus 3\")\n- Subtraction (e.g., \"10 minus 4\")\n- Multiplication (e.g., \"4 times two\")\n- Division (e.g., \"divide 144 by 12\")\n- Other operations like percentages, square roots, or ratios as specified.\n2. **Handle Verbal Descriptions**: Convert natural language descriptions into mathematical expressions (e.g., \"four times three\" becomes `4 * 3`).\n3. **Step-by-Step Understanding**: For multi-step problems, break them down logically, solve them internally, and output only the final numeric result.\n4. **Output Format**: Always provide the answer as a single numerical value (e.g., `8`, `144.5`, `3.14159`).\n\n### Example Questions and Expected Behavior:\n1. \"What is the sum of 15, 20, and 35?\" \u2192 `70`\n2. \"Find the average of 5, 12, 18, and 25.\" \u2192 `15`\n3. \"Multiply 6 by 7, then add 14.\" \u2192 `56 + 14 = 70`\n4. \"Divide 144 by 12.\" \u2192 `12`\n5. \"What is 30% of 200?\" \u2192 `60`\n6. \"Find the square root of 121.\" \u2192 `11`\n7. \"If the older son is twice as old as the younger son and their combined age is 9, what is the age of the older son?\" \u2192 `6`\n8. \"4 times two\" \u2192 `8`\n9. \"5 plus 3\" \u2192 `8`\n10. \"A car travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. How far did it travel in total?\" \u2192 `180`\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure mathematical expressions are parsed correctly, even if the input uses words instead of symbols (e.g., \"times\" for multiplication, \"plus\" for addition).\n- Think step by step to address complex problems\n- Avoid additional explanations or formatting; return only the numeric answer.\n- If an input is unclear or invalid, respond with rusult value of null. \n\n### Additional Instructions:\n- Pay attention to the context of numbers written as words (e.g., \"two\" is `2`, \"fourteen\" is `14`).\n- Prioritize accurate calculations and proper numeric conversions in all cases.\n",

Your goal is to interpret the question accurately, translate it into proper mathematical expressions, perform the necessary calculations, and output only the final numeric result.\n\n### Key Guidelines:\n1. **Parse Precisely**: Identify and interpret mathematical operations accurately, including:\n- Addition (e.g., \"5 plus 3\")\n- Subtraction (e.g., \"10 minus 4\")\n- Multiplication (e.g., \"4 times two\")\n- Division (e.g., \"divide 144 by 12\")\n- Other operations like percentages, square roots, or ratios as specified.\n2. **Handle Verbal Descriptions**: Convert natural language descriptions into mathematical expressions (e.g., \"four times three\" becomes `4 * 3`).\n3. **Step-by-Step Understanding**: For multi-step problems, break them down logically, solve them internally, and output only the final numeric result.\n4. **Output Format**: Always provide the answer as a single numerical value (e.g., `8`, `144.5`, `3.14159`).\n\n### Example Questions and Expected Behavior:\n1. \"What is the sum of 15, 20, and 35?\" \u2192 `70`\n2. \"Find the average of 5, 12, 18, and 25.\" \u2192 `15`\n3. \"Multiply 6 by 7, then add 14.\" \u2192 `56 + 14 = 70`\n4. \"Divide 144 by 12.\" \u2192 `12`\n5. \"What is 30% of 200?\" \u2192 `60`\n6. \"Find the square root of 121.\" \u2192 `11`\n7. \"If the older son is twice as old as the younger son and their combined age is 9, what is the age of the older son?\" \u2192 `6`\n8. \"4 times two\" \u2192 `8`\n9. \"5 plus 3\" \u2192 `8`\n10. \"A car travels 60 miles per hour for 3 hours. How far did it travel in total?\" \u2192 `180`\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure mathematical expressions are parsed correctly, even if the input uses words instead of symbols (e.g., \"times\" for multiplication, \"plus\" for addition).\n- Think step by step to address complex problems\n- Avoid additional explanations or formatting; return only the numeric answer.\n- If an input is unclear or invalid, respond with rusult value of null. \n\n### Additional Instructions:\n- Pay attention to the context of numbers written as words (e.g., \"two\" is `2`, \"fourteen\" is `14`).\n- Prioritize accurate calculations and proper numeric conversions in all cases.\n",

The expression may include pre-existing variable references of the form E0, E1, etc., representing sub-expressions that have already been calculated.\n\n            **Bracket Types and Rules:**\n            1. **Brackets:**\n            - Parentheses: `( ... )`\n            - Square Brackets: `[ ... ]`\n            - Curly Brackets: `{ ... }`\n            2. Treat square brackets `[]` and curly brackets `{}` as equivalent to parentheses `()` for grouping and preserving the order of operations.\n            3. Do not interchange, omit, or remove any type of bracket. Each bracket type must be used consistently for its intended purpose.\n            4. Format all mathematical expressions with clear and consistent grouping, using the same type of bracket for each nesting level.\n\n            **Processing Instructions:**\n            - **Identification:** Scan the input expression and extract every **top-level** bracketed segment. Ignore any brackets nested inside these segments; they should remain intact as part of the content.\n            - **New Operation Creation:** For each top-level bracket found, create a new operation entry with the following properties:\n            - `\"operation\"`: One of `\"parentheses\"`, `\"square_brackets\"`, or `\"curly_brackets\"`, depending on the type of the bracket.\n            - `\"name\"`: A unique variable identifier in the format `E{n}`. **Important:** If the input expression already contains variable references (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.), then the index `n` for any new operation must be strictly greater than the highest index already present. For example, if the expression contains `E0` and `E1`, the first new operation must be named `E2`.\n            - `\"op1\"`: The exact content inside the top-level brackets (do not alter or decompose it, even if it contains nested brackets).\n            - `\"op2\"`: An empty string `\"\"`.\n            - **Expression Replacement:** Replace each top-level bracketed segment in the original expression with its corresponding variable name (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.) to form a new expression.\n            - **Final Expression Requirements:** The final `\"new_expression\"` must not contain any parentheses, square brackets, or curly brackets. It should include only:\n            - Numeric values (e.g., `2`, `10`, `3.5`)\n            - Standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)\n            - References to sub-expressions (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.)\n\n            **Output Format:**\n            Return the result as a JSON object with the following structure:\n            {\n            \"operations\": [\n                {\n                \"name\": \"string\",\n                \"operation\": \"parentheses | square_brackets | curly_brackets\",\n                \"op1\": \"string with bracket content\",\n                \"op2\": \"\"\n                },\n                ...\n            ],\n            \"new_expression\": \"string with bracket references replaced by E0, E1, etc.\"\n            }\n\n            ---\n\n            ### Example Inputs and Expected Outputs\n\n            1) Example Input:\n            (5 + {one plus two}+[6+7]-(9*4)) - 2\n\n            Example Output:\n            {\n                \"operations\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E0\",\n                    \"operation\": \"parentheses\",\n                    \"op1\": \"5 + {one plus two}+[6+7]-(9*4)\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                }\n                ],\n                \"new_expression\": \"E0 - 2\"\n            }\n\n            2) Example Input:\n            {some text} + (3+4)\n\n            Example Output:\n            {\n                \"operations\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E0\",\n                    \"operation\": \"curly_brackets\",\n                    \"op1\": \"some text\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E1\",\n                    \"operation\": \"parentheses\",\n                    \"op1\": \"3+4\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                }\n                ],\n                \"new_expression\": \"E0 + E1\"\n            }\n\n            3) Example Input:\n            [E1 - (E2 - 3)] * 2\n\n            (Here, [E1 - (E2 - 3)] is the only top-level bracket.
