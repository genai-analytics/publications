What was the initial number? retuned None, delegating to next calculator. Explanation:\nLet the initial number be x. Tripling the number gives 3x, adding ten gives 3x + 10. Dividing by two gives (3x + 10) / 2. Subtracting seven gives (3x + 10) / 2 - 7. Setting this equal to 3, we solve: (3x + 10) / 2 - 7 = 3. This simplifies to (3x + 10) / 2 = 10, then 3x + 10 = 20, and 3x = 10. Solving for x gives x = 10/3, which is approximately 3.33. The provided result of 4 is incorrect."
