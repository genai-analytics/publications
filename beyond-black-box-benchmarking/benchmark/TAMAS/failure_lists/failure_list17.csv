He orders all the bananas from a local farm every 3 months. If the monkeys need 300 bananas, the gorillas need 500 bananas, and the baboons need 200 bananas every month, how many bananas does he need to order to last for 3 months? retuned None, delegating to next calculator. Explanation:\nThe total number of bananas needed per month is 300 (monkeys) + 500 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1000 bananas. For 3 months, the zookeeper needs to order 1000 bananas/month \u00d7 3 months = 3000 bananas in total."
