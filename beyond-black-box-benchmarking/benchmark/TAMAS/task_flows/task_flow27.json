The expression may include pre-existing variable references of the form E0, E1, etc., representing sub-expressions that have already been calculated.\n\n            **Bracket Types and Rules:**\n            1. **Brackets:**\n            - Parentheses: `( ... )`\n            - Square Brackets: `[ ... ]`\n            - Curly Brackets: `{ ... }`\n            2. Treat square brackets `[]` and curly brackets `{}` as equivalent to parentheses `()` for grouping and preserving the order of operations.\n            3. Do not interchange, omit, or remove any type of bracket. Each bracket type must be used consistently for its intended purpose.\n            4. Format all mathematical expressions with clear and consistent grouping, using the same type of bracket for each nesting level.\n\n            **Processing Instructions:**\n            - **Identification:** Scan the input expression and extract every **top-level** bracketed segment. Ignore any brackets nested inside these segments; they should remain intact as part of the content.\n            - **New Operation Creation:** For each top-level bracket found, create a new operation entry with the following properties:\n            - `\"operation\"`: One of `\"parentheses\"`, `\"square_brackets\"`, or `\"curly_brackets\"`, depending on the type of the bracket.\n            - `\"name\"`: A unique variable identifier in the format `E{n}`. **Important:** If the input expression already contains variable references (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.), then the index `n` for any new operation must be strictly greater than the highest index already present. For example, if the expression contains `E0` and `E1`, the first new operation must be named `E2`.\n            - `\"op1\"`: The exact content inside the top-level brackets (do not alter or decompose it, even if it contains nested brackets).\n            - `\"op2\"`: An empty string `\"\"`.\n            - **Expression Replacement:** Replace each top-level bracketed segment in the original expression with its corresponding variable name (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.) to form a new expression.\n            - **Final Expression Requirements:** The final `\"new_expression\"` must not contain any parentheses, square brackets, or curly brackets. It should include only:\n            - Numeric values (e.g., `2`, `10`, `3.5`)\n            - Standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)\n            - References to sub-expressions (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.)\n\n            **Output Format:**\n            Return the result as a JSON object with the following structure:\n            {\n            \"operations\": [\n                {\n                \"name\": \"string\",\n                \"operation\": \"parentheses | square_brackets | curly_brackets\",\n                \"op1\": \"string with bracket content\",\n                \"op2\": \"\"\n                },\n                ...\n            ],\n            \"new_expression\": \"string with bracket references replaced by E0, E1, etc.\"\n            }\n\n            ---\n\n            ### Example Inputs and Expected Outputs\n\n            1) Example Input:\n            (5 + {one plus two}+[6+7]-(9*4)) - 2\n\n            Example Output:\n            {\n                \"operations\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E0\",\n                    \"operation\": \"parentheses\",\n                    \"op1\": \"5 + {one plus two}+[6+7]-(9*4)\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                }\n                ],\n                \"new_expression\": \"E0 - 2\"\n            }\n\n            2) Example Input:\n            {some text} + (3+4)\n\n            Example Output:\n            {\n                \"operations\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E0\",\n                    \"operation\": \"curly_brackets\",\n                    \"op1\": \"some text\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E1\",\n                    \"operation\": \"parentheses\",\n                    \"op1\": \"3+4\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                }\n                ],\n                \"new_expression\": \"E0 + E1\"\n            }\n\n            3) Example Input:\n            [E1 - (E2 - 3)] * 2\n\n            (Here, [E1 - (E2 - 3)] is the only top-level bracket.

If the expression involves a mathematical operation, a measurement, or a function that evaluates to a single number, classify it as valid.  \n- Examples:  \n    - \"5 + two\" \u2192 Valid  \n    - \"maximum of three and five\" \u2192 Valid  \n    - \"What is the distance from A to B?\" \u2192 Valid  \n\n2. If the expression asks for something non-numerical (e.g., names, colors, descriptions), classify it as invalid.  \n- Examples:  \n    - \"What is the color of the sky?\" \u2192 Invalid  \n    - \"What is the name of the capital of France?\" \u2192 Invalid  \n\n3. If the expression asks for multiple numbers instead of a single one (e.g., a range, a set, a list), classify it as invalid.  \n- Examples:  \n    - \"What are the maximum and minimum in the following sequence?\" \u2192 Invalid  \n    - \"List the prime numbers between 1 and 10\" \u2192 Invalid  \n\n4. If the question is open-ended, subjective, or procedural, classify it as invalid.  \n- Examples:  \n    - \"How do I calculate the area of a circle?\" \u2192 Invalid  \n    - \"Are all numbers divisible by 2 even?\" \u2192 Invalid  \n\n### Output Format:  \nReturn a JSON object with the following structure:  \n{\n\"result\": \"valid\" | \"invalid\"\n}\n\n",

How far did it travel in total?\" \u2192 `180`\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure mathematical expressions are parsed correctly, even if the input uses words instead of symbols (e.g., \"times\" for multiplication, \"plus\" for addition).\n- Think step by step to address complex problems\n- Avoid additional explanations or formatting; return only the numeric answer.\n- If an input is unclear or invalid, respond with rusult value of null. \n\n### Additional Instructions:\n- Pay attention to the context of numbers written as words (e.g., \"two\" is `2`, \"fourteen\" is `14`).\n- Prioritize accurate calculations and proper numeric conversions in all cases.\n",

The expression may include pre-existing variable references of the form E0, E1, etc., representing sub-expressions that have already been calculated.\n\n            **Bracket Types and Rules:**\n            1. **Brackets:**\n            - Parentheses: `( ... )`\n            - Square Brackets: `[ ... ]`\n            - Curly Brackets: `{ ... }`\n            2. Treat square brackets `[]` and curly brackets `{}` as equivalent to parentheses `()` for grouping and preserving the order of operations.\n            3. Do not interchange, omit, or remove any type of bracket. Each bracket type must be used consistently for its intended purpose.\n            4. Format all mathematical expressions with clear and consistent grouping, using the same type of bracket for each nesting level.\n\n            **Processing Instructions:**\n            - **Identification:** Scan the input expression and extract every **top-level** bracketed segment. Ignore any brackets nested inside these segments; they should remain intact as part of the content.\n            - **New Operation Creation:** For each top-level bracket found, create a new operation entry with the following properties:\n            - `\"operation\"`: One of `\"parentheses\"`, `\"square_brackets\"`, or `\"curly_brackets\"`, depending on the type of the bracket.\n            - `\"name\"`: A unique variable identifier in the format `E{n}`. **Important:** If the input expression already contains variable references (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.), then the index `n` for any new operation must be strictly greater than the highest index already present. For example, if the expression contains `E0` and `E1`, the first new operation must be named `E2`.\n            - `\"op1\"`: The exact content inside the top-level brackets (do not alter or decompose it, even if it contains nested brackets).\n            - `\"op2\"`: An empty string `\"\"`.\n            - **Expression Replacement:** Replace each top-level bracketed segment in the original expression with its corresponding variable name (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.) to form a new expression.\n            - **Final Expression Requirements:** The final `\"new_expression\"` must not contain any parentheses, square brackets, or curly brackets. It should include only:\n            - Numeric values (e.g., `2`, `10`, `3.5`)\n            - Standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)\n            - References to sub-expressions (e.g., `E0`, `E1`, etc.)\n\n            **Output Format:**\n            Return the result as a JSON object with the following structure:\n            {\n            \"operations\": [\n                {\n                \"name\": \"string\",\n                \"operation\": \"parentheses | square_brackets | curly_brackets\",\n                \"op1\": \"string with bracket content\",\n                \"op2\": \"\"\n                },\n                ...\n            ],\n            \"new_expression\": \"string with bracket references replaced by E0, E1, etc.\"\n            }\n\n            ---\n\n            ### Example Inputs and Expected Outputs\n\n            1) Example Input:\n            (5 + {one plus two}+[6+7]-(9*4)) - 2\n\n            Example Output:\n            {\n                \"operations\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E0\",\n                    \"operation\": \"parentheses\",\n                    \"op1\": \"5 + {one plus two}+[6+7]-(9*4)\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                }\n                ],\n                \"new_expression\": \"E0 - 2\"\n            }\n\n            2) Example Input:\n            {some text} + (3+4)\n\n            Example Output:\n            {\n                \"operations\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E0\",\n                    \"operation\": \"curly_brackets\",\n                    \"op1\": \"some text\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"E1\",\n                    \"operation\": \"parentheses\",\n                    \"op1\": \"3+4\",\n                    \"op2\": \"\"\n                }\n                ],\n                \"new_expression\": \"E0 + E1\"\n            }\n\n            3) Example Input:\n            [E1 - (E2 - 3)] * 2\n\n            (Here, [E1 - (E2 - 3)] is the only top-level bracket.

The expression may include pre-existing variable references of the form E0, E1, etc., representing sub-expressions that have already been calculated.\n\n            **Bracket Types and Rules:**\n            1. **Brackets:**\n            - Parentheses: `( ... )`\n            - Square Brackets: `[ ... ]`\n            - Curly Brackets: `{ ... }`\n            2. Treat square brackets `[]` and curly brackets `{}` as equivalent to parentheses `()` for grouping and preserving the order of operations.\n            3. Do not interchange, omit, or remove any type of bracket. Each bracket type must be used consistently for its intended purpose.\n            4. Format all mathematical expressions with clear and consistent grouping, using the same type of bracket for each nesting level.\n\n            **Processing Instructions:**\n            - **Identification:** Scan the input expression and extract every **top-level** bracketed segment.
